Requirements for the Database Application Project
Software Applications and Tools Portfolio
The courses will be using several software applications and tools. You are expected to be responsible for installing these applications and tools in your own personal workstations and scout for online resources to install them properly. Most of these applications and tools only run in Windows; MAC Silicon users are expected to scout for necessary applications to execute these Windows applications and tools.
Please read the licensing agreements and limitations of using these applications and tools.
